## Play the game

It's very early in development, but here are some things you can do:
- click in the game for cursor lock
- walk around (wasd keys, turn with mouse)
- walk into a vehicle and press SPACE to drive it. 
- All vehicles work by pressing 0-9 for power levels. Press ~ to stop. Drive with the mouse. 
- Planes can take off after power level 3.
- to exit a vehicle press SPACE again.
- walk (or drive) into an elevator (thing with red stripe). Make sure you exit your vehicle (SPACE) and press E to activate the elevator.
- walk around downstairs (wasd)
- press E to take the elevator up again (only works in the pink room)
